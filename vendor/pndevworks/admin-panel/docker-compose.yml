# This image is just for running tests only in PHP with PHPUnit. To run the
# test, you can run it with composer: 
# 
#  composer run test:docker

# You will need to login your docker first tough. See
# https://gitlab.com/PNDevworks/Tools/handbook/-/blob/master/docs/gitlab-registry-authenticate.md
# or ask your manager :D
